 * Google AdSense configuration.

 * The loader script (in the root layout) enables **Auto Ads** as soon as Auto
 * Ads is switched on in the AdSense dashboard — no slot IDs required.
 *
 * For the controlled, non-intrusive manual placements (a bottom-of-page banner
 * and a unit below each game) create display ad units in AdSense and paste
 * their slot IDs below. While a slot is empty the placement renders nothing,
 * so gameplay is never pushed around by an empty box.
